# Shopping List

A small project to login and keep track of a shopping list


## TODO's

The idea for this is to use several new technologies (new for me) to make this simple project which I might even use?

My initial approach would be:

- Login to your account
- Show all shopping lists of this user
- Allow multiple users per shopping list (shopping list is main db entry)
- Don't worry about simultaneous editting, but would be nice if it worked
- Use mongoDB as database
- Front-end with React



## Expansions

- Taking notes
- Cross compatible on Android? iOS? lol no iOS most likely
